# Access All Areas

A new site I built for the outdoor event publication _Access All Areas_.

The site uses the wordpress rest api v1 to fetch content from the old site which is then compiled into a static site using  [spike](https://www.spike.cf/).

## Running locally

- make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) is at version >= `6`
- `npm i spike -g`
- clone this repo down and `cd` into the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `spike watch` or `spike compile`
